# TODOs

After implementing the whole book, we'll do the following:

-   [ ] Add tests according to the original repository of bob nystrom
-   [ ] Implement all (or most) of the challenges
-   [ ] Cleanups according to chapter "Cleanup"

## Cleanup

-   `ObjInstance` should become just `ObjObject`, bc we also want obj literals
-   `ObjClass` should become `ObjStruct`...?
