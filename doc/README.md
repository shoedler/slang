## TODOs

### Phase 1

-   [x] Base implementation of the VM

### Phase 2

-   [ ] Re-read the book & comment the code accordingly
-   [ ] Implement all (or most) of the challenges

### Phase 3

-   [ ] Constant folding directly in the compiler
-   [ ] Implement `break`
-   [ ] Implement `continue`
-   [ ] Implement `inc` and `dec` operators, maybe as a separate OpCode
-   [ ] Implement `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
-   [ ] Implement sequences

### Phase 999

-   [ ] Implement a JIT compiler
